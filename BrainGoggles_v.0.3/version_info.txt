Android 2.3, Motorola Droid 3

BrainGoggles is a fork in AntiLightSwitch v.0.0.3

Update 5/24/2013 v.0.0.3
-BrainGoggles Android removed the drawing of spheres and added an oscilloscope to display the voltage on one input.

Update 8/3/2013 v.0.1
-BrainGoggles is now v.0.1 to move into Beta version so that when it works, 1.0 will match the board version.

Update 8/7/2013 v.0.2
-I will now move from v.0.1 to v.0.2 to work since v0.1 shows basic signs of working in the 1.0 board for a single input (input 2)
-The first thing I'm trying with v.0.2 is updating the IDEs and recompiling:
Android 2.3.4, Motorola Droid 3
Ketai 8 for Gingerbread (9 is for Android 2.3.7)
Processing 2.0.1 (64 bit) on Windows 7 (64 bit)
Arduino 1.0.5 (no bit specified), "Chinese" Nano 3.0 with ATMega328, DF-BluetoothV3
-At first glance, it looks like everything worked!
